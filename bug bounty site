The Smarter Bug Hunting (For Low Hanging Bug)

ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Gather Recon Data
The foundation of bug hunting is solid reconnaissance. Use tools like Amass and Subfinder to discover subdomains.

#amass enum -d http://target.com  
#subfinder -d http://target.com -o subdomains.txt

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Target overlooked assets like staging environments or old subdomainsâ€”gold mines for misconfigurations!

ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Look for Open Ports
Scanning for open ports and services can lead you to hidden vulnerabilities. Use Nmap:

#nmap -sV -p- -iL subdomains.txt -oN nmap_results.txt

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Pay attention to non-standard ports; they often harbor interesting services.

ðŸ“Œ Step 3: Identify Vulnerable Endpoints
Use httpx to detect live endpoints:

#httpx -l subdomains.txt -o live_endpoints.txt

Follow up with FFUF for fuzzing:

#ffuf -u https://target.com/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -mc 200,403

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Fuzz for directories like /admin, /test, and /backup.

ðŸ“Œ Step 4: Test for Common Bugs
Some of the easiest yet impactful vulnerabilities include

1. IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References)
2. Misconfigurations in headers or access controls
3. Default credentials in login panels

Example: Testing for IDOR with Burp Suite:

1. Intercept requests and modify object IDs or parameters.
2. Observe the response for unauthorized data.

ðŸ“Œ Step 5: Automate Your Findings
Tools like Hakrawler can help you crawl and identify more endpoints:

#hakrawler -url https://target.com -depth 2 -plain > urls.txt

Pair it with ParamSpider for parameter discovery:

#python3 http://paramspider.py --domain http://target.com

ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaway: Focus on actionable bugs with high reproducibility. These might seem small, but in the right context, theyâ€™re incredibly impactful!
